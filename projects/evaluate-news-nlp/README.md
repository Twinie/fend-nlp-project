# EVALUATE NEWS NLP Project

## Overview
I have invoked the meaningCloud.com web API for sentiment analysis on submission of the report.

## Instructions
The Dist folder and node modules is not submitted as per the requirement of the project. It can be created by running a command on the terminal - npm run build-prod.

## Extras
As guided by the API docs, I added the text on which I need the Sentiment Analysis, I added the API key which was sent through a response of a get request to the client and then used as the key has to be protected publicly.
